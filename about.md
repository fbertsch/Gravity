In 2016 I started working for [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org) as a [Firefox](http://www.firefox.com) [Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assumption_(short_story)) [Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_converter). My overarching goal is to make Mozilla more data-driven; my day-to-day activities include writing code and formulating baseless claims.

As a [telemetry.mozilla.org module peer](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules/Firefox#telemetry.mozilla.org), I own the [aggregation job and service](https://github.com/mozilla/python_mozaggregator) which powers [TMO dashboards](https://telemetry.mozilla.org/new-pipeline/evo.html). I'm the primary data engineer for Firefox Mobile, where I take [questions](https://www.github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/59), decide which [datatum we need](https://github.com/mozilla-services/mozilla-pipeline-schemas/commit/ef065dafd8a202d699745ad593b5add5e210511c), build out [ETL pipelines](https://github.com/mozilla/telemetry-batch-view/pull/203), and finally answer the original questions.

In 2015 I took a job with [ISE](http://wwww.iseinc.biz) as a big data contractor for [John Deere](https://www.deere.com). We built data pipelines for 1000Hz data coming from combines, analyzing the results in an effort to improve productivity and yield. Our efforts led to a new version of combine released in 2016.

(( Here we move to Iowa City for my wife to begin medical school ))

In 2014 I interned at [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com), working with [SQL Azure Telemetry Data](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2806845&CFID=932480642&CFTOKEN=29323160). We delivered an easy-to-use Telemetry dataset to the academic community, meanwhile analyzing trends and usage in the data ourselves.

That same year my wife and I had our second child - Sawyer.

2013 took me to SF Bay, where I interned at [Twitter](http://twitter.com). I did long-term analysis of hardware lifetimes, in an effort to find which products and vendors were the most reliable - for the price, of course.

I decided to head to [grad school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_National_Monuments_of_the_United_States) in 2012, where I studied in the Databases department at [UW-Madison](http://cs.wisc.edur)].

(( Magically transport to Madison, WI ))

That year I graduated from [Xavier University](http://xavier.edu) with degrees in Physics and Computer Science.

In what seems like ancient history now, during undergrad I did web development and data analysis at [Coupsmart](http://www.coupsmart.com/) (How is that link not dead?).
